## Why I teach this course

This course takes 2% of my year.

Success rate is about one person per year, and that's ok.

Knowing how to program is like having a super power.

Programming gives you a tool that you can use to make other tools.

I put in a constant effort, and you get a super power forever.

You have to believe what I tell you. I have 40 years experience and you
have zero :-)

You _have to_ have the right attitude!

You are in fact very close to being programmers, you just don't know it.

## Programming is actually pretty simple

It's all just common sense. Think about how you would do something in the
real world, then do that in the computer.

Things that make programming seem hard are: weird names, weird details,
frozen accidents.

Programming is often dressed up to look harder than it is. People with
knowledge making themselves seem important and protecting their positions.

It might look like there are big differences between you, but that's not
the case at all. Not in what you already know and not in your aptitude,
since what's mainly needed is clear thinking and common sense.

If you're not getting something, probably half the people in the room
aren't either. Speak up!

There are _very few_ control flow things (if/then/else, looping).

There are _very few_ data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries).

These things are just fancy names for things you have been doing every day
for your entire life.

Almost all programs start & grow in the same way. From something very
simple. From an itch. They always look complex when you arrive late, after
many incremental rounds of development.

All programming languages are (more or less) the same.

## General comments on programming

It's actually *really great* to know nothing and to have no background.
There is no stronger position. No one assumes things about you, there are
no dumb questions, you don't have to pretend, you can learn without
acquiring bad habits.

We're all piecemeal in our knowledge because this is not our job. That's
ok. It means within a short amount of time of starting you will know
things that (more experienced) others will not, and that, in reverse,
people who overall know much less than you will know more about some
aspects than you do. Don't be arrogant, help one another.

I only know things piecemeal because I never really made computers my
job. You'll always be piecemeal too. It means you'll always have holes,
people will always know more than you do. It means you'll complement others
and vice versa. Be humble, be useful.

I have to look things up all the time!

Information processing is fundamental. Evolution shapes us to efficiently
process information. Now we've reached the point where a species can build
machines that simulate other machines and write programs to run on them to
process information however we like. It's quite extraordinary.  Working
with information is somehow so fundamental.  It's like math, only even more
general.

Being able to write code is really a general skill that is likely to be of
use to you no matter what your occupation is.

## Description of course, aims, beliefs, etc.

Broad range of students in the class. Help each other. Be generous.  Close
the gaps. Make yourselves into a little community. Self support, teach,
etc.

Solve problems just over the horizon of what you can do without programming.

This is a course for beginners. If you're not a beginner, you're expected
to help others.

Let's have a note taker in each class. Take notes in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), push them
into
[our class repo github](https://github.com/acorg/2018-cambridge-python-course)
(which is what you're looking at now).

Learn by solving real problems, not in a dry, theoretical way.

## Course aims

Get you "over the hump" and turn you into a programmers (or a better
programmer).

Get you using the shell (more or less) efficiently.

Get rid of fear.

Show you how to help yourselves.

Show you what's possible - breadth not depth. There are lots of moving
parts to understand - let's not get hung up on too many of them.  The idea
is to get you programming and then give a broad sweep of what's possible.

When non-programmers working with data run into a problem they cannot solve
with pre-existing tools (e.g., Excel), the reaction is usually either to
ask someone else for help, to do it manually, or to give up. In this course
we will add another option: write a program. The course aim is concrete and
modest: turn you into someone who, when faced with a data problem, thinks
"I can write a quick script to solve that problem" (and then does so). Many
people go back to their regular lives after taking courses, don’t put into
practice what they learned, and eventually forget it all. I don’t want that
to happen with our course. We'll aim to turn everyone into an active
programmer. To get you going on a path that fundamentally changes how you
work with data for the rest of your career. It’s impossible to learn
everything about programming in a week, but it is possible to take the
crucial first steps and to make them stick.

## Topics

There are three things that are closely tied together in what you’ll be
doing in the course. 1) You'll write code in the Python language. 2) You'll
do that in a text editor. You'll then 3) run those programs on the command
line (using bash).

Why learn about two languages (Python and the shell), isn't one hard enough?

### Shell

* Wildcards
* Pipes
* Input / output redirection
* Variables
* Loops
* Common commands
* Using the command-line efficiently in the shell
* Git and GitHub
* Snakemake (14:30 to 16:30 Thursday)

### Python

* Whitespace is important!
* If/elif/else
* While loops
* Standard input and output
* Variables / Lists / Sets / Dictionaries
* Importing modules - like using a cookbook
* Simple programs
* Functions
* Exercises
    * Common words
    * Hangman
    * Guess a number
* Plotting
* Classes - are exactly like factories
* Jupyter notebooks
* Pandas (Leonie, Thursday)


### Notes

cd
tr
pwd

ls
ls -l 

less - use space to see a page, and 'q' to quit
cat
>
|

mv
mkdir
rmdir

cp - copy a file

control-d - terminate input
control-c - interrupts program

~ is your home directory
